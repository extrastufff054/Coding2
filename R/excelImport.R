            # file: The file path or URL of the Excel file you want to read.
            # sheetIndex: Optional. The index of the sheet in the Excel file that you want to read. The default value is 1, which represents the first sheet.

            # colNames: Optional. A logical value indicating whether column names should be generated if the Excel file does not have column names. The default value is TRUE.
            # detectDates: Optional. A logical value indicating whether date columns should be automatically converted to date objects in R. The default value is TRUE.

    ## Example :
        # Reading the Excel file from the current working directory
             read.xlsx("data.xlsx", sheetIndex = 1)
        # Reading the Excel file from a URL
             read.xlsx("https://www.example.com/data.xlsx")
        # Reading the Excel file from a specific sheet
             read.xlsx("data.xlsx", sheetIndex = 2)
             read.xlsx("data.xlsx", sheetName = "Sheet2")
        # Reading the Excel file from a specific row
             read.xlsx("data.xlsx", startRow = 5)
             read.xlsx("data.xlsx", startRow = 5, endRow = 10)
        # Reading the Excel file without column names
             read.xlsx("data.xlsx", header = FALSE)
        # Reading the Excel file without column names and generating column names in R
             read.xlsx("data.xlsx", header = FALSE, colNames = FALSE)
        # Reading the Excel file without date conversion
             read.xlsx("data.xlsx", detectDates = FALSE)
        # Reading the Excel file without skipping empty rows
             read.xlsx("data.xlsx", skipEmptyRows = FALSE)
